# Discussion-Forum
Our website would be a combined platform for discussions, announcements, posts and various events.
A forum with stylish user-interface and user-compatibility would make information handling easier for the students as well as the university.
This way, the university, the page admins, and the corresponding subscribers of those pages can be in direct contact and have discussions about the same at the same platform itself!
